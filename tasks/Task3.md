Task 2. Deadlines: Nov 11 / Nov 18

- Get familiar with the AXI4-Lite protocol — even if your current IP doesn’t require it, you’ll need this knowledge in future courses

- Implement at least one driver according to your module’s specification
- [Optional] If you find it useful, modify your setup to allow the driver to send responses back to the sequence and test
- Create additional tests or refine existing ones to produce meaningful and effective stimuli
- Run simulations, inspect the waveforms, and verify that everything behaves as expected (and do some debugging if it doesn’t :P).
